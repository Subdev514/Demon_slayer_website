      <h2>Demon slayer as an anime</h2>
      <p>It is no suprise that demon slayer(Kimetsu no Yaiba) has been poping up as one of the most good looking ainmes
        of all time. Sure, as an anime the story isn't the best among the more popular titles with great excution,
        Although the last fight was I feel greatly executed and is one of the reasons I am exicted about season 2. But
        If there is one thing that keeps me comming back to this show in genre over and over again is the simplictic
        nature that everyone has able to enjoy both as a kid and still now years later as a fully functioning fully
        grown up kid(pretending to be an adult), there is no need for some long convoluted hook like that time I tried
        becomeing president of my ninja village, when my best friend has joined ninja issis(aka naruto). Everything you
        need to know is incapsulated in a nice short and snapy title. Naurto- is about a ninja named naruto, one piece-
        is about a grand adventure to find the tressure named one piece(probabbly idk i have never seen soo....), my
        hero academia- is about heroes in academia(again probabbly i have never seen so idk but tell me if i should
        watch it) and demon slayer- is about a guy who has a really cute sister........ ohh! and also slays demons.(Yes
        I stole that line.. I mean was HEAVLY inspired by the Gigguk on yt which btw I highly recommend checking him
        out)

    <p>The story takes place in Taishō-era Japan. It follows Tanjiro Kamado and his sister Nezuko Kamado as they seek a
      cure for Nezuko's demon curse. Tanjiro and Nezuko become entangled in the affairs of a secret society, known as
      the Demon Slayer Corps, that has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. The demons are former
      humans who sold their humanity in exchange for power. They feed on humans and possess supernatural abilities such
      as super strength, magic, and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they're decapitated with weapons crafted
      from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight.
      The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human; however, they employ special breathing techniques, known
      as "Breathing Styles", which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance.</p>
